                <p>We have a specialist team of managers with specific industry experience and expertise to assist with a range of property developments from industrial and commercial
                 to residential and recreationa</p>
                <p>Some specific areas we can assist with are:</p> 
                <p>Strata title offices</p>
                <p>Industrial warehouses</p>
                <p>Retail outlets</p>

                <p>Working capital finance</p>
                <p>Factories, shops and vacant land</p>
                <p>Depending on the development, we can typically arrange a development loan for up to 70% of the gross value of the property, and even up to 100% on the total 
                development cost (depending on the strength of the development).</p>
                <p>Cash flow funding is a facility to provide your business with funding outstanding invoices giving quick access to the proceeds of approved credit sales, often within 24 
                hours of processing the invoices.
                Short term funding is also available by offering equity in the property without any need to refinance the property.
                This facility is ideal for financing the needs of well managed and financially sound businesses. It is fully confidential with all existing collection and customer relationship 
                functions retained by the business.</p>
                <p>Benefits:</p>
                <p>Removes the need to offer discounts to customers for early settlement of accounts </p>
                <p>Generates significant profits from potentially accessing supplier discounts for early payment</p>
                <p>Accelerates cash flow by receiving payments sooner and making more effective use of available working capital</p>

                            In today’s modern world a number of known brands and even many lesser known brands have franchised operations and provide opportunities for business owners to enter into a business based on a tried and proven model.
                        </p>
                        <p>Most banks now have franchise loans where they will extend some security value against the ‘brand’ of a franchise. This may mean clients need not necessarily provide as much security as the business will have an underlying value that a bank will rely upon. This value does not normally exist with other business types outside the franchise systems.</p>
                        <p>We are well versed with finance for franchises and aware of what packages are available via different financial institutions. Even some lesser known franchises can still be financed and we are well placed to assist.</p>
