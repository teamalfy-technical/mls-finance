                <p>Your first investment in property, however, need not be your home. Buying an investment property can be a good way to get your foot on the property ladder while you 
                are renting or still living at home. It’s called ‘Rentvesting’.Many people feel locked out of the housing market as the areas they want to live in become increasingly 
                unaffordable. Rentvesting is an alternative way to get started. Rent in a suburb that suits your lifestyle, and purchase an investment property that fits your budget.</p>
                <p>Rentvesting therefore is a strategy that saves people from becoming renters their entire life. It gives struggling first home buyers an opportunity to enter the market, even if it’s not as their first home. </p>
                <p>Sensible investments in property have many benefits. Property can be less volatile than shares and it tends to be regarded as a safe haven when other assets are declining 
                    in value.</p>
                <p>Property has the potential to generate capital growth (an increase in the value of your asset) as well as rental income. There are also tax advantages associated with 
                    owning an investment property.</p>
                <p>Buying real estate, whether you are buying the family home or an investment, is one of life’s most important financial decisions. However, when buying an investment 
            property, it is wise to remember that you are making a business decision. You are not buying from the heart, but from the head. You are buying the property because you 
            expect it to appreciate in value and give you a financial return. </p>

                <p>Interest rates move constantly, so you will need to allow room in your budget for interest rate increases and other unforeseen additional spending. When interest rates 
                drop, maintaining the same repayments with the savings going into your offset account is one of the fastest ways of paying off more of your loan and building a buffer 
                if they rise again.</p>
                <p>
                Think very carefully about the different loan product offerings available and how these relate to your spending and saving habits. Consider options such as an offset 
                account that will enable you to take advantage of using any excess cash to save on interest. It’s also a great account to use to save for your next investment property.</p>
