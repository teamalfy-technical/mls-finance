                        <p>
                            MLS Finance can arrange finance for cars, boats, motorbikes, jet skis and other registerable items. The most common form of financing is through a secured loan. The asset purchased is used by the lender as security for the loan often allowing a lower interest rate in return.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Leasing, hire purchase and chattel mortgage loans are available for vehicles used for at least 50% of business needs.</p>
                        <p>At MLS we make sure the client application meets all lending criteria to provide the best chance of securing approval</p>

                        <p>
                            An asset lease enables you to have the use of your business equipment and the benefits of ownership while a lender retains actual ownership of the equipment. The lender purchases the equipment on your behalf and you then pay the lender a fixed monthly lease rental for the term of the lease.
                        </p>
                        <p>At the end of the lease, you have the option to either pay a residual on the lease and take ownership of the equipment, sell the equipment or re-finance the residual and continue the lease.</p>

                        <p>
                        A chattel mortgage is an ideal way for individual business customers to maximise the taxation benefits gained from financing new plant & equipment. It is designed for those sole traders and partnerships who account for their business operations on a cash basis and can be used for purchasing new equipment or upgrading existing equipment.

                        Commercial hire purchase agreements are typically used by individual business customers who wish to place a deposit into their finance contract or nominate the value of the balloon (final instalment) on their contract. This type of contract offers maximum flexibility to set the monthly repayment amount to suit individual circumstances.

                    <h2 class="fw-600">Hire Purchase</h2>
                    <p>A novated lease is a three-way agreement between the employer, employee and the lender. The employer, employee and financier sign a novation agreement whereby the employer agrees to take on the employeeâ€™s obligations under the lease. Under this arrangement, the employer makes the monthly lease payments on behalf of the employee.</p>
                    <p>
                    Should the employee leave his or her employment for any reason, the novation agreement ceases and the obligations assumed by the employer revert to the employee as the registration is in the employeeâ€™s name.</p>
                    <p>The choice of the vehicle remains with the employee ensuring a vehicle fully meet their needs.</p>
                    <p>The employer deducts a portion of the vehicle financing and running costs from the employeeâ€™s pre-tax income reducing the employeeâ€™s taxable income and the amount of tax payable. There is no need for the employee to do anything on their tax returns as the employer and lender attend to this.</p>
                    <p>If a vehicle is purchased using another form of finance, 100% of the costs will be taken from after-tax income providing no tax benefit at all. With the option of a fully maintained lease, vehicle running costs such as maintenance, registration, insurance costs and projected fuel can also be included in regular salary deductions.</p>
                    <p>MLS can also assist with finding the right vehicle as well as offering fleet discounts on the purchase price and running costs.</p>
